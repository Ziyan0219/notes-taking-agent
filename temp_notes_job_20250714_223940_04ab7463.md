## Comprehensive Exercises

*These exercises combine concepts from multiple topics*

### Comprehensive Exercise 1 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

In a linear regression task, you are implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the cost function. The per-example objective function for each training example 'i' is given by J(i)(Œ∏) = ‚àë(Œ∏T x(i) - y(i))^2, where Œ∏ is the parameter vector, x(i) is the feature vector for example 'i', and y(i) is the true target value. You are using the gradient descent formula i=1(‚àáJ(i)(Œ∏)) = ‚àë(Œ∏T x(i) - y(i))x(i) to update the parameter vector Œ∏. Given a specific dataset and initial parameter values, calculate the updated parameter values after one iteration of SGD using the provided formulas.

#### Solution Approach

1. Calculate the per-example gradient: ‚àáJ(i)(Œ∏) = (Œ∏T x(i) - y(i))x(i)
2. Select a random training example 'i'
3. Compute the per-example gradient using the selected example
4. Update the parameter vector Œ∏ using the formula: Œ∏_new = Œ∏ - Œ± * ‚àáJ(i)(Œ∏), where Œ± is the learning rate
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each training example to complete one full iteration of SGD

### Comprehensive Exercise 2 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

In a machine learning project, a student is using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to optimize a model with a per-example objective function. The student has a total of 1000 training examples. The per-example objective function is defined as J(i)(Œ∏) = i^2, where i represents the index of the training example. Calculate the Stochastic Gradient Descent Objective Function (J(Œ∏)) for this scenario.

#### Solution Approach

To calculate the Stochastic Gradient Descent Objective Function (J(Œ∏)), we first need to find the per-example objective function value for each training example i from 1 to N, which is 1000 in this case. Substituting the per-example objective function J(i)(Œ∏) = i^2 into the formula J(Œ∏) = Œ£ J(i)(Œ∏) for i=1 to N, we get J(Œ∏) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 1000^2. This can be computed using the formula for the sum of squares of the first N natural numbers, which is N(N+1)(2N+1)/6. Plugging in N=1000, we get J(Œ∏) = 1000(1000+1)(2*1000+1)/6. Calculate this expression to find the final value of J(Œ∏).
